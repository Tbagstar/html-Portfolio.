<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello there. You're welcome to know about me. My name is stephen Okoro Nkata and I am a citizen of Nigeria. I studied 
  Industrial Mathematics and Applied Statistics In the University of Enugu State Science and Technology Agbani Enugu.
  I came from a christian home as i was rasied by my mother whom i love so much, I lost my dad when i was barely 6
  being a fatherless child i had 5 Siblings and i'm the last among them so my childhood was terrific
</p>

<p>Despite the fact i don't have a good childhood memories i always dreamed and desired to be Great, Different and 
  Outstanding. I always believed in God to use me, help me and impower me to do great things. I have a track record of pain
  and suffering which has helped me discover my true purpose.

<p>Growing up i wanted to be a doctor as a kid that's what i aspired for, within time i changed the idea to be a doctor to 
  an electrical engineer. But i was unfortunate to get an engineering course because i didn't get up to the score so the
  Institution now added me to Statistics class lol. Seeing how the world is evolving and the world becoming more digital and 
  Techy i Then aspire to be a Programmer. Though it's not an easy journey i know i will be one of the greatest Tech engineer 
  To be. This is a short essay about me and i hope you find me interest. Thanks for visiting my website and Remain blessed.
